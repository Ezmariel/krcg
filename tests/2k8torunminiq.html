Deck name: Along comes the spider
Description: This deck won the mini qualifier in Torun, a local
tournament in Warsaw, and managed to get into the final round during
the Polish ECQ.  it's a very solid deck against most archetypes, card
flow is really impressive, and it does tend to be underestimated (not
too often, but it happens).  it's also a very fun deck to play, in the
ideal setup you block out your predator while making constant pressure
on your prey.

Library - 90
Master
2 Dreams of the Sphinx
3 Vessel
2 Blood Doll
2 Direct Intervention (I'm thinking about adding another one, this
card is cruicial for any block denial actions, or things that simply
screw your spiders)
1 Giant's Blood
1 Jungle Hunting Ground
1 Powerbase: Tshwane (there was some magic around this card, I got it
in every single game, in the first 10 cards drawn)
1 WMRH Talk Radio (didn't use it at all, metagame wasn't stealth heavy
though)
1 Mbaare Market, Harare
1 Legendary Vampire
1 Ancestor Spirit

Action
3 No Secrets of the Magaji (was thinking about 4-5, but 3 is a good
number, you draw too much attention if you put it on too early)
3 Belonging Grants Protection
2 Restoration
1 Aranthebes, the Immortal
1 Army of Rats

Action modifier
7 Freak Drive
5 Predator's Transformation (wonderful card, can play it anytime, and
the bonus superior effect did help a lot many times)
4 Predator's Mastery (lovely thanks to several ally decks playing)
1 Akunanse Kholo
1 Strange Day (won me the final pretty much)

Political action
2 The Secret Must be Kept (amazing card against any ally deck)
1 anarchist uprising
1 ancilla empowement (nobody really expects these 2 until its too
late)

Equipment
2 Sniper Rifle
1 Ivory Bow
1 Reliquiary: Akunanse Remains
1 Kduva's Mask

Retainer
5 Raven spy
1 Shaman

Combat
5 Carrion Crows
5 Invoking the Beast
4Taste of Vitae
4 Rolling with the Punches
3 Skin of Steel
2 Canine horde (crucial in the final)
2 Flesh Bond (butt-saver)
2 Superior Mettle (I'd revise the prevent cards anyway, maybe adding
some with no cost, or more of SM. it worked nice in overall though)

Reaction
4 Predator's Communion (very helpful before you get no secrets, easy
to drop afterwards)
