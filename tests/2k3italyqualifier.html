Library 90

Master 14

3 Jake Washington (Hunter) (He is perfect for both the WG and let my
midcaps eat if hungry)
1 Hungry Coyote (after the tournament I have decided that the Jakes
are enough for this and that my minions have always better actions to
do rather than hunt. I would change it for a Pentex "anti helena/Lucas
halton/..." Subversion)
4 Palla Grande
1 The Art of Pain
2 Blood Doll
1 Direct Intervention
2 Vicissitude
1 Anarch troublemaker

Action 24

3 The Embrace (extremely useful for bleed and multiple action as
rescuing from torpor/eating alive/rush walls)
9 Art Scam
9 Enchant Kindred
3 Entrancement (To defend my omelettes, for bleeding or for an
extrarecruitment if ever able, this card is so great)
5 The Summoning (key, essential, If you summon a WG and the action is
blocked you don't lose the Meat machine so you could try it later, and
it also multiplies the number of getting a WG from my library)

Action modifier 12

6 Changeling
6 Change of Target (for the embraces aswell and the Ghouls if an evil
killer vamps untaps suddenly while attacking)

Combat 7

7 Majesty

Allies/Retainers 8

4 War Ghoul
2 Marijava Ghoul (exceptionals, There are 15 pressence action cards
and this makes 'em more efficient, but he is also meat for the WG god)
1 Tasha Morgan
1 J.S. Simons

Reactions 14

4 Wake With evening freshness
2 Forced Awakening (helps to dry my vamps before drinking a full Jake for supper)
4 Telepathic Misdirection
4 My enemy's enemy

Combo

5 Plasmic Form
