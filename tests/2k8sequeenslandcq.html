Comments: Well the run is you get Arika out, wait a turn
(hopefully no pentex, smash, or her getting torped), next
you equip her with soul gem, Freak Drive to untap, then
call Praxis S whatever to increase her capacity +1 and to
make her prince of whatever, Awe it so you burn the blood
off Arika down to 2, pass the vote with 22 votes for, now
you are ready to bleed, force of will +2 bleed, daring the
dawn to make it unblockable at inferior, conditioning for
a bleed of 8, taking 3 agg damage burning Arika and a new
ones comes into play. Play Praxis, Awe, Force of Will,
Daring the Dawn, Conditioning bleed of 8, if you get stuck
you can play distraction to not only get rid of the other
soul gems and rubbish from your hand but to get back on
track with the card combo. freak drive to then call PS

repeat until you have wiped everyone out
